# Semantic-Segmentation-Cityscapes

For this study, we use three different pre-existing models: SegNet, U-Net, and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) with VGG-16 as the encoder. Afterward, we perform several experiments on it and compare them with each other. In addition, we also use some traditional and modern techniques in order to increase the performance accuracy of the models.
