# Semantic-Segmentation-Cityscapes

In this work, we present a full detailed report on semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset. For this study, we use three different pre-existing models: SegNet, U-Net, and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) with VGG-16 as the encoder. Afterward, we perform several experiments on them and compare them to each other. In addition, we also use some traditional and modern techniques in order to increase the performance accuracy of the models.
